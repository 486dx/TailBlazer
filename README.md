# Tail Blazer

In my day to day professional life I am always tailing log files but have always been dissapinted with the freebies on offer.The current crop of free ones all look like they were written in the 1990s, are very ugly and have limited functionality.

So I have decided to recify this by creating a more modern version. 

The misson statement is it has to be fast, intuitive and functionally rich.
